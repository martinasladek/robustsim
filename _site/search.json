The code for reproducing the plots found on this page can be accessed at osf.io/jvdrp.\nThe summaries are split into four main sections:\n\nBetween-subjects designs with categorical predictors\nCross-sectional designs with numeric-only predictors\nCross-sectional designs with combined numeric and categorical predictors\nWithin subjects and mixed designs\n\nEach section contains summaries for individual designs, including the overall model fit, rates of false positives, statistical power, accuracy of estimates, estimation efficiency, coverage of confidence intervals, and rates of model convergence errors.\nEach plot shows sample size on the X axis and relevant metric on the Y axis. Columns are defined by the effect size and rows are grouped by a combinations of remaining parameters.\nTo save space on the plots, some labels use shorter codes - these are specified in the table below.\n\n\n\nCode\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nhet_shape\nHeteroscedastic shape/variance pattern\n\n\nN cat. preds\nNumber of categorical predictors\n\n\nN cont. preds\nNumber of numeric/continuous predictors\n\n\nn_het\nNumber of heteroscedastic predictors\n\n\nN preds\nNumber of predictors\n\n\nN ratio\nSample size ratio\n\n\ntarget_het\nTarget heteroscedasticity value on the QLI measure\n\n\nvp1\nHomoscedastic variance pattern\n\n\nvp2\nButterfly variance pattern\n\n\nvp3\nInverse butterfly variance pattern\n\n\nvp4\nFunnel variance pattern\n\n\nVR\nVariance ratio"
